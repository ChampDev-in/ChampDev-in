👋 Hello, I'm [Your Name], a passionate developer with a love for building robust, scalable, and maintainable software solutions.

🚀 My journey in software development began [4 years ago] when I fell in love with the world of coding. Since then, I've focused my efforts on mastering Java and Spring Boot, becoming proficient in creating high-performance, enterprise-grade applications.

💼 In my professional career, I've had the privilege of working on a diverse range of projects, including **Prepaid Wallet,Prepaid Card Management System**, where I honed my skills in:

- Developing RESTful APIs and microservices using Spring Boot.
- Integrating and configuring Spring Security for robust application security.
- Leveraging Spring Data and Hibernate for efficient data persistence.
- Collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver innovative solutions.

🌱 I'm a strong advocate for continuous learning and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in Java and Spring Boot. I'm always eager to explore new technologies and tools to ensure that my projects are cutting-edge.

🤝 I believe in the power of open source and have contributed to various Java and Spring Boot projects. I'm an enthusiastic collaborator and enjoy helping others by sharing my knowledge through articles, tutorials, and community forums.

📫 Let's connect and discuss exciting opportunities or collaborate on meaningful projects. Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddhantkamat). I'm always open to engaging with fellow developers, sharing experiences, and making the tech world a better place.

🚗 Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new places, enjoying the great outdoors, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
